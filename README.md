## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/music-app.git
cd music-app
```

### 2. Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file inside `backend/`:
```env
PORT=5000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=music_app
DB_PORT=5432
```

Run the backend server:
```bash
npm start
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app should now be running locally — backend on `http://localhost:5000` and frontend on the port shown by Vite (typically `http://localhost:5173`).
